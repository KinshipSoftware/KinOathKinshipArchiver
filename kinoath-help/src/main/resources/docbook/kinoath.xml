            <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">KinOath Kinship Archiver is a kinship application designed,
              first of all, to link kinship data with archived data such as, for example, media
              resources (i.e. audio files, video files, etc.). Secondly, being culturally
              nonspecific, this program makes it possible for users to create diagrams based on
              culturally, and therefore linguistically, different social structures; such diagrams
              can then be compared and contrasted. A series of options are included which aim to
              optimize graphical representation of the data, a key feature within KinOath
              environment. </td>

    <para>KinOath Kinship Archiver is part of the Language Archiving Technology suite. You will find
      a link to the program on the TLA web page <ulink
        url="http://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/kinoath"
        >http://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/kinoath</ulink>. You can either start it - with no
      installation needed - through the option <emphasis role="bold">Run via webstart</emphasis>, or
      you can install it on your computer by selecting one of the installers provided next to "Run
      via webstart". In both cases you will need Java installed on your machine for the application
      to run. For more information on Java and how to install it go to <ulink

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">New (default diagram)</emphasis>: this option allows you to
              open a new diagram. It says "<emphasis role="italic">default</emphasis> diagram"
              because when KinOath opens it shows the diagram that was previously set as default
              through the option "Set Default Diagram as" (see below). </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">New Diagram of Type</emphasis>: this option allows you to

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Open Diagram</emphasis>: this option allows you to open a
              diagram choosing from the ones present in your computer directories. Once you have
              selected the file you need and clicked <emphasis role="bold">Open</emphasis> this will
              open in a new page of KinOath. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Open Recent Diagram</emphasis>: through this option you can
              select and re-open one of the diagrams which were previously opened. If you want to
              delete the list of diagrams opened you can select <emphasis role="bold">Clear

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Open Sample Diagram</emphasis>: KinOath includes a number of
              sample diagrams through which you can observe how the application works (see section
              2.1.2.). You can open and examine these sample diagrams by selecting this option. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Import Gedcom / CSV File</emphasis>: this option allows you
              to import kinship files in either Gedcom or CSV format. Once it is selected a window
              will open asking you to choose the file to import from a directory; the file selected
              will then open in a new page of KinOath.</para>

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Import Sample Data</emphasis>: some of the diagrams require
              data to be imported before starting to work on them. A list of sample data is
              accessible via this option. Once the import is complete a new panel will appear
              containing all the entities imported (<emphasis role="bold">Imported

              you to export files (in one of the following formats: PDF, JPEG, PNG and TIFF) to a
              directory in your computer. As in the previous option, "Save as", when selecting
              "Export as ..." you will be asked to choose a directory and a file name plus, in this
              case, a file format. </para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Standard Diagram (database driven)</emphasis>: when
                selecting this type, a new page of KinOath Kinship Archiver will open, with a
                central, blank panel and a smaller panel on the left which includes three tabs:
                  <emphasis role="bold">Search Entities</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Project
                  Tree</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Diagram Tree</emphasis>. Through the
                first one you can search for entities which are already present in the database . A
                complete list of such entities is provided in the second tab. In the third tab, by
                contrast, you are able to see the specific entities you have selected from the
                database and/or the ones you have created. Speaking about new entities, you can
                create a completely new diagram from scratch using the several options of the menu
                that comes out when right clicking in the main panel:<orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add</emphasis>: you may decide to add an <emphasis
                        role="bold">Individual</emphasis>, a <emphasis role="bold"
                        >Chromosome_Example</emphasis>, a <emphasis role="bold"
                        >Clan_Example</emphasis>, or any other entity type selected in the profiles
                      settings, to your diagram. In both cases, a new entity will appear,
                      represented by a small square icon (unless configured otherwise). If you
                      select that entity you will see, at the bottom of the page, a table with
                      information to fill in, such as names, dates, genders, etc. Once the data
                      regarding an entity has been entered you can save it either by clicking on the
                      entity itself, or by choosing - from the right click menu - the option
                        <emphasis role="bold">Save All Data Changes</emphasis>.</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add Geometry</emphasis>: its sub-options are:
                        <emphasis role="bold">Add Label</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Add
                        Circle</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Add Square</emphasis>, and
                        <emphasis role="bold">Add Ellipse</emphasis>. The first (label) allows you
                      to enter a label for your diagram, and you can do it by entering the text into
                      a small window opening at the bottom of the page when the option is selected.
                      The other three are graphic options you can use to differentiate kin groups
                      (circle, square, ellipse).</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Delete</emphasis>: this option allows you to delete
                      the selected entity from the database and from all diagrams. </para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Merge Selected Entities</emphasis>: you can use this
                      option when, for example, you have two separate entities carrying different
                      pieces of information but, at a certain moment, you discover that they are the
                      same individual, and therefore you want to make them merge into a single
                      entity. What results from the merger is a single individual carrying the
                      information of the two merged entities. [Note: at the moment it only merges
                      the entities but not the kinship data that such entities carry]</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Duplicate Selected Entities</emphasis>: when
                      choosing this option, the entity/ies previously selected will be doubled.

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add Relations</emphasis>: once that several, single
                      entities have been created, you may also want to create relations between
                      them. To this purpose, select how many entities you need (by clicking on them
                      while holding down the SHIFT button on the keyboard) and right click. You can
                      choose between: <emphasis role="bold">sibling</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">ancestor</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"
                      >descendant</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">union</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">kinterm</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">other</emphasis> (the
                      last one means that the relation connecting two, or more, entities, is not a
                      sanguine relation). In addition, if you want to add only a relation of the
                      type "descendant" or "ancestor", you can simply select one entity and drag the
                      blue line to the other. [Note: as for these two last options, the choice of
                      one or the other depends on which entity you select first. In other words: if
                      you select the parent first, then you have to use the descendant relation,
                      whereas if you select the child first, you will have to choose the ancestor
                      relation.]</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Remove Relations</emphasis>: you may also want to
                      change some of the relations created. To do so, select the necessary entities,
                      right click, and choose "Remove Relations" > <emphasis role="bold">Remove
                        relations between selected</emphasis>.</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Set as ego (list will be cleared)</emphasis>: in the
                      "Diagram Tree" panel on the left of the page you see three lists: <emphasis
                        role="bold">Ego</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Required</emphasis>, and
                        <emphasis role="bold">Implied</emphasis>. When you create new entities they
                      automatically go under the "Required" list or, depending on the relations that
                      have been created, under the "Implied" list. However, if you want to create an
                      egocentric diagram you can select one of the entities and - through "Set as
                      ego (list will be cleared)" - transfer it to the "Ego" list. Such entity will
                      go black. [You can also create socialcentric diagrams, in which no particular
                      entity is set as starting point of the diagram.] The option contains the words
                      "list will be cleared", which means that through this command, only one entity
                      can be set as the reference-ego in one diagram; to add more egos, because many
                      diagrams may have been created, you need to use "Add to ego list" (see
                      below).</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add to ego list</emphasis>: this option is similar
                      to the previous one. You can select entities and add them to the "Ego" list in
                      the "Diagram Tree" panel on the left of the page.</para>

                      option you remove the selected entity/ies from the diagram, but in this case
                      it/they remain(s) in the database, unlike with the option "Delete" described
                      above.</para>

              <para><emphasis role="bold">Freeform diagram (transient)</emphasis>: when selecting
                this type, a new page of KinOath will open, with a central, blank panel and a
                smaller panel on the top called <emphasis role="bold">Kin Type Strings</emphasis>.
                Also here you can create diagrams from scratch but the difference from the previous
                case is that you need to enter strings in the panel on the top of the page, using
                precise kin types definitions. Hereinafter there is a list of the main ones (which
                can be also found following the path: "Panels" > "Diagram Settings" > "Kin Type
                Definitions"):</para>
              <para>E = ego; Ef = ego female; Em = ego male; x = undefined</para>
              <para>F or Fa = father; M or Mo = mother; P or Pa = parent</para>

              <para>* = first-degree relatives </para>
              <para>Besides the mere kin type definitions, however, you can also add labels to the
                entities, such as names and dates. To do so, you have first to enter a colon after
                the kin type definition and then the label(s). Different labels belonging to the
                same entity need to be separated by a semi-colon. Another colon goes after the last
                label and before the (if any) following kin type definition (see figure below). </para>

              <para><emphasis role="bold">Kin Terms Diagram</emphasis>: this type of diagram is
                useful when you want to observe how social relations develop and are named within a
                given language and culture. When you choose this diagram a new page of KinOath
                Kinship Archiver opens, with a central, blank panel, and a smaller panel on the
                right called <emphasis role="bold">Kin Term Group</emphasis>. In the latter, you can
                see a table that has to be filled in order to create the diagram: in the first
                column (<emphasis role="bold">Kin Term</emphasis>) you have to enter, as the name
                itself says, the kin terms that will represent also the labels of the entities in
                the diagram; in the second column (<emphasis role="bold">Referent Kin Type
                  Strings</emphasis>) you have to enter, for each kin term, its corresponding
                definition, i.e. the letters listed in the "Freeform Diagram" paragraph; in the
                fourth column (<emphasis role="bold">Description</emphasis>) you can add, for
                example, an English gloss if the kin terms entered are in another language. In
                addition, you can decide to: a) show the kin terms on the diagram, or hide them, by
                checking or unckecking the option <emphasis role="bold">Show on graph</emphasis>,
                above the table; b) delete some of the kin terms entered in the table by checking
                them and then clicking on <emphasis role="bold">Delete Selected</emphasis>, or c)
                delete the entire kin terms group by simply clicking on <emphasis role="bold">Delete
                  Group</emphasis>, on the left of "Delete Selected". Next to 'Show on graph', there
                is the option <emphasis role="bold">Generate Example Entities</emphasis>; it is
                checked by default and, if you uncheck it, the diagram will not be created. However,
                you can still create a diagram through the kin type strings panel from the panel
                menu. </para>

                make a query by using the kin type definitions listed in the "Freeform Diagram"
                paragraph, plus pieces of information such as names, dates. Or, you can directly

                  </para>
                  <para>Besides, you may want to add new kin types to the list. Mind that a new kin
                    type added to a standard diagram behaves differently from a new kin type added
                    to a freeform diagram. Let's make an example: </para>
                  <para>Kin Type String: Q</para>
                  <para>Relation Type: sibling</para>
                  <para>Symbol Type: triangle, circle</para>
                  <para>As far as a standard diagram is concerned, the new kin type represents a
                    filter, which means that when I look up an entity, e.g. Albert_Iof_Monaco, and
                    use the 'Q' kin type, in the central panel I will see the entity searched for,
                    plus all those other individuals (both male and female given the previously set
                    symbol types) carrying a sibling-relation type with it. To put it simply, I will
                    see Albert_Iof_Monaco and his, possibly existing, brother/s and sister/s.</para>
                  <para>By contrast, in the case of a freeform diagram, what the new kin type does
                    is create new entities from scratch. In other words, if in the Kin Type Strings
                    panel I type, for example, 'EfQ', in the central panel I will see a female ego
                    which is the - so to speak - reference point of my diagram, together with a
                    brother (sibling relation + triangle) and a sister (sibling relation + circle).  </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para><emphasis role="bold">Label Fields</emphasis>: this tab contains some
                    information about the entities created by the user (we are referring to the
                    "Standard Diagram (database driven)" type), i.e. name, date of birth, etc. You
                    can delete such pieces of information by clicking on the small squares on the
                    right of the tab [see red arrow]. However, they still remain in the table at the
                    bottom of the page (the one filled in when cretaing individuals), so if you want
                    to add them back to the panel on the top you just need to take them, one at a
                    time, and drag them to the "Label Fields" panel. <figure>

      <title>...release VS delete entities</title>
      <para>There are two options through which you can remove entities from your diagram:</para>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Delete</emphasis>: the delete option will remove an entity
              from all the diagrams, and also from the database. Once you select it (select the
              entity/ies you want to remove and right click) a message will pop up telling you that
              a number of entities will be deleted from the database.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Release from diagram</emphasis>: this option (select the
              needed entity/ies > right click) will simply remove an entity from the diagram, but
              unlike 'delete' it will <emphasis role="underline">not</emphasis> remove it from the

      <title>...add entities via search tab</title>
      <para>The second way to add entities to your diagram is through the Search Entities
        tab:</para>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Follow the same steps explained in section 3.1, i.e. [If you do not already have a
              project-based diagram open (see section 2.1 above - option 'Open Diagram')] File menu
              > New Diagram of Type > Standard diagram (database driven). </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>On the left of the page select the tab <emphasis role="bold">Search
                Entities</emphasis>. In the white field under <emphasis role="bold">Search Entity
                Names</emphasis> type the name of an entity that you know is present in the
              database; then click <emphasis role="bold">Search</emphasis>. In the white column
              under 'Search' you will see a list of all the entities (partially) matching your
              query. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The option <emphasis role="bold">Graph selection</emphasis> (below the 'Search
              Entity Names' white field) is checked by default; this means that when you select an
              entity from the list given to you after the query is made, this will automatically
              appear in the main panel. If you uncheck this option, you will have to manually drag
              the selected entity to the main panel. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Another option that may turn useful is <emphasis role="bold">Expand selection by
                kin type string</emphasis> (below 'Graph selection'). If you check it, and then
              enter some kin types in the white field below it, you will see the previously selected
              entity changing accordingly. E.g. type 'Albert' and then click 'Search'. Select one of
              the entities that appear in the list: it will appear also in the main panel. Then
              check the field 'Expand selection...' and type '*'. All (if any) first-degree
              relatives related to the entity selected will appear on the diagram as well. </para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>To the kin types you can attach some labels, namely names, dates, etc. To do so,
              enter a colon after the kin type, then separate each of the label with a semi-colon,
              and finally enter another colon between the last label and the next kin type. The
              labels have to be entered with a precise order: Id [mind that the Id is normally used
              when you have two entities with the same kin type definition], name, date of birth -
              date of death. E.g. Ef:Jane;1950-2010:M:Carla;1925-2000:.....</para>

                    will see only that entity in particular. As in the previous case, you can also
                    add further kin types, and the diagram in the main panel will change
